  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user180\n**Date:** 2020-11-02\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

Further analysis unlikely to change conclusion.\n- Moderate: Mixed but interpretable evidence. 2+ signals with partial consistency, some contradictions \n  that don't override the main pattern. Requires careful weighing. Refinement may help clarify.\n- Difficult: Sparse, contradictory, or highly ambiguous evidence. <2 clear signals OR multiple strong \n  contradictions. Multiple interpretations possible. Further analysis unlikely to resolve ambiguity.\n\n## Output Format\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"Prediction\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Depression\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Stress\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\"\n  },\n  \"Confidence\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Depression\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Stress\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\"\n  },\n  \"Key_Insights\": \"Summarize the main patterns and indicators you observed in 2-3 sentences\",\n  \"Difficulty\": \"Easy\" or \"Moderate\" or \"Difficult\",\n  \"Challenges\": \"Explain why you chose this difficulty level based on the Rubric. For 'Easy', explain what made it clear. For 'Moderate', what aspects are mixed?

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user180\n**Date:** 2020-05-20\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user180\n**Date:** 2019-09-18\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

Further analysis unlikely to change conclusion.\n- Moderate: Mixed but interpretable evidence. 2+ signals with partial consistency, some contradictions \n  that don't override the main pattern. Requires careful weighing. Refinement may help clarify.\n- Difficult: Sparse, contradictory, or highly ambiguous evidence. <2 clear signals OR multiple strong \n  contradictions. Multiple interpretations possible. Further analysis unlikely to resolve ambiguity.\n\n## Output Format\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"Prediction\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Depression\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Stress\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\"\n  },\n  \"Confidence\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Depression\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Stress\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\"\n  },\n  \"Key_Insights\": \"Summarize the main patterns and indicators you observed in 2-3 sentences\",\n  \"Difficulty\": \"Easy\" or \"Moderate\" or \"Difficult\",\n  \"Challenges\": \"Explain why you chose this difficulty level based on the Rubric.

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user180\n**Date:** 2020-11-28\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

Further analysis unlikely to change conclusion.\n- Moderate: Mixed but interpretable evidence. 2+ signals with partial consistency, some contradictions \n  that don't override the main pattern. Requires careful weighing. Refinement may help clarify.\n- Difficult: Sparse, contradictory, or highly ambiguous evidence. <2 clear signals OR multiple strong \n  contradictions. Multiple interpretations possible. Further analysis unlikely to resolve ambiguity.\n\n## Output Format\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"Prediction\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Depression\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Stress\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\"\n  },\n  \"Confidence\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Depression\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Stress\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\"\n  },\n  \"Key_Insights\": \"Summarize the main patterns and indicators you observed in 2-3 sentences\",\n  \"Difficulty\": \"Easy\" or \"Moderate\" or \"Difficult\",\n  \"Challenges\": \"Explain why you chose this difficulty level based on the Rubric.

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user180\n**Date:** 2019-02-19\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

Further analysis unlikely to change conclusion.\n- Moderate: Mixed but interpretable evidence. 2+ signals with partial consistency, some contradictions \n  that don't override the main pattern. Requires careful weighing. Refinement may help clarify.\n- Difficult: Sparse, contradictory, or highly ambiguous evidence. <2 clear signals OR multiple strong \n  contradictions. Multiple interpretations possible. Further analysis unlikely to resolve ambiguity.\n\n## Output Format\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"Prediction\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Depression\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Stress\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\"\n  },\n  \"Confidence\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Depression\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Stress\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\"\n  },\n  \"Key_Insights\": \"Summarize the main patterns and indicators you observed in 2-3 sentences\",\n  \"Difficulty\": \"Easy\" or \"Moderate\" or \"Difficult\",\n  \"Challenges\": \"Explain why you chose this difficulty level based on the Rubric. For 'Easy', explain what made it clear. For 'Moderate', what aspects are mixed? For 'Difficult', why is it ambiguous?\",\n  \"Focus_Areas_for_Refinement\": \"If Moderate or Difficult: what specific aspects should be examined more carefully in the next analysis?

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user166\n**Date:** 2022-04-03\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

Be clear and direct - you will have \nopportunities to refine later if needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must adhere to the following assessment rubric and output format.\n\n## Difficulty Assessment Rubric\nYou MUST classify the difficulty of this prediction based on the evidence quality:\n- Easy: Clear, converging evidence. 3+ consistent signals across modalities with minimal contradictions. \n  High confidence is appropriate. Further analysis unlikely to change conclusion.\n- Moderate: Mixed but interpretable evidence. 2+ signals with partial consistency, some contradictions \n  that don't override the main pattern. Requires careful weighing. Refinement may help clarify.\n- Difficult: Sparse, contradictory, or highly ambiguous evidence. <2 clear signals OR multiple strong \n  contradictions. Multiple interpretations possible. Further analysis unlikely to resolve ambiguity.\n\n## Output Format\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"Prediction\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Depression\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Stress\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\"\n  },\n  \"Confidence\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Depression\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Stress\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\"\n  },\n  \"Key_Insights\": \"Summarize the main patterns and indicators you observed in 2-3 sentences\",\n  \"Difficulty\": \"Easy\" or \"Moderate\" or \"Difficult\",\n  \"Challenges\": \"Explain why you chose this difficulty level based on the Rubric. For 'Easy', explain what made it clear. For 'Moderate', what aspects are mixed? For 'Difficult', why is it ambiguous?\",\n  \"Focus_Areas_for_Refinement\": \"If Moderate or Difficult: what specific aspects should be examined more carefully in the next analysis? If Easy: state 'None - evidence is clear'.\"\n}",
  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user166\n**Date:** 2020-06-17\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

Be clear and direct - you will have \nopportunities to refine later if needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must adhere to the following assessment rubric and output format.\n\n## Difficulty Assessment Rubric\nYou MUST classify the difficulty of this prediction based on the evidence quality:\n- Easy: Clear, converging evidence. 3+ consistent signals across modalities with minimal contradictions. \n  High confidence is appropriate. Further analysis unlikely to change conclusion.\n- Moderate: Mixed but interpretable evidence. 2+ signals with partial consistency, some contradictions \n  that don't override the main pattern. Requires careful weighing. Refinement may help clarify.\n- Difficult: Sparse, contradictory, or highly ambiguous evidence. <2 clear signals OR multiple strong \n  contradictions. Multiple interpretations possible. Further analysis unlikely to resolve ambiguity.\n\n## Output Format\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"Prediction\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Depression\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Stress\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\"\n  },\n  \"Confidence\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Depression\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Stress\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\"\n  },\n  \"Key_Insights\": \"Summarize the main patterns and indicators you observed in 2-3 sentences\",\n  \"Difficulty\": \"Easy\" or \"Moderate\" or \"Difficult\",\n  \"Challenges\": \"Explain why you chose this difficulty level based on the Rubric. For 'Easy', explain what made it clear. For 'Moderate', what aspects are mixed? For 'Difficult', why is it ambiguous?\",\n  \"Focus_Areas_for_Refinement\": \"If Moderate or Difficult: what specific aspects should be examined more carefully in the next analysis? If Easy: state 'None - evidence is clear'.\"\n}",
  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user166\n**Date:** 2020-03-30\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

Further analysis unlikely to change conclusion.\n- Moderate: Mixed but interpretable evidence. 2+ signals with partial consistency, some contradictions \n  that don't override the main pattern. Requires careful weighing. Refinement may help clarify.\n- Difficult: Sparse, contradictory, or highly ambiguous evidence. <2 clear signals OR multiple strong \n  contradictions. Multiple interpretations possible. Further analysis unlikely to resolve ambiguity.\n\n## Output Format\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"Prediction\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Depression\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Stress\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\"\n  },\n  \"Confidence\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Depression\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Stress\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\"\n  },\n  \"Key_Insights\": \"Summarize the main patterns and indicators you observed in 2-3 sentences\",\n  \"Difficulty\": \"Easy\" or \"Moderate\" or \"Difficult\",\n  \"Challenges\": \"Explain why you chose this difficulty level based on the Rubric.

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user166\n**Date:** 2020-10-28\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

Further analysis unlikely to change conclusion.\n- Moderate: Mixed but interpretable evidence. 2+ signals with partial consistency, some contradictions \n  that don't override the main pattern. Requires careful weighing. Refinement may help clarify.\n- Difficult: Sparse, contradictory, or highly ambiguous evidence. <2 clear signals OR multiple strong \n  contradictions. Multiple interpretations possible. Further analysis unlikely to resolve ambiguity.\n\n## Output Format\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"Prediction\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Depression\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Stress\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\"\n  },\n  \"Confidence\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Depression\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Stress\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\"\n  },\n  \"Key_Insights\": \"Summarize the main patterns and indicators you observed in 2-3 sentences\",\n  \"Difficulty\": \"Easy\" or \"Moderate\" or \"Difficult\",\n  \"Challenges\": \"Explain why you chose this difficulty level based on the Rubric. For 'Easy', explain what made it clear. For 'Moderate', what aspects are mixed? For 'Difficult', why is it ambiguous?\",\n  \"Focus_Areas_for_Refinement\": \"If Moderate or Difficult: what specific aspects should be examined more carefully in the next analysis? If Easy: state 'None - evidence is clear'.\"\n}",
  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user166\n**Date:** 2018-12-30\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

Be clear and direct - you will have \nopportunities to refine later if needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must adhere to the following assessment rubric and output format.\n\n## Difficulty Assessment Rubric\nYou MUST classify the difficulty of this prediction based on the evidence quality:\n- Easy: Clear, converging evidence. 3+ consistent signals across modalities with minimal contradictions. \n  High confidence is appropriate. Further analysis unlikely to change conclusion.\n- Moderate: Mixed but interpretable evidence. 2+ signals with partial consistency, some contradictions \n  that don't override the main pattern. Requires careful weighing. Refinement may help clarify.\n- Difficult: Sparse, contradictory, or highly ambiguous evidence. <2 clear signals OR multiple strong \n  contradictions. Multiple interpretations possible. Further analysis unlikely to resolve ambiguity.\n\n## Output Format\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"Prediction\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Depression\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Stress\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\"\n  },\n  \"Confidence\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Depression\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Stress\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\"\n  },\n  \"Key_Insights\": \"Summarize the main patterns and indicators you observed in 2-3 sentences\",\n  \"Difficulty\": \"Easy\" or \"Moderate\" or \"Difficult\",\n  \"Challenges\": \"Explain why you chose this difficulty level based on the Rubric. For 'Easy', explain what made it clear. For 'Moderate', what aspects are mixed? For 'Difficult', why is it ambiguous?\",\n  \"Focus_Areas_for_Refinement\": \"If Moderate or Difficult: what specific aspects should be examined more carefully in the next analysis? If Easy: state 'None - evidence is clear'.\"\n}",
  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user11\n**Date:** 2019-06-20\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user11\n**Date:** 2019-12-02\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user11\n**Date:** 2021-03-12\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user11\n**Date:** 2019-11-04\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user11\n**Date:** 2020-10-22\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user104\n**Date:** 2020-03-14\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

Further analysis unlikely to change conclusion.\n- Moderate: Mixed but interpretable evidence. 2+ signals with partial consistency, some contradictions \n  that don't override the main pattern. Requires careful weighing. Refinement may help clarify.\n- Difficult: Sparse, contradictory, or highly ambiguous evidence. <2 clear signals OR multiple strong \n  contradictions. Multiple interpretations possible. Further analysis unlikely to resolve ambiguity.\n\n## Output Format\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"Prediction\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Depression\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Stress\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\"\n  },\n  \"Confidence\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Depression\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Stress\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\"\n  },\n  \"Key_Insights\": \"Summarize the main patterns and indicators you observed in 2-3 sentences\",\n  \"Difficulty\": \"Easy\" or \"Moderate\" or \"Difficult\",\n  \"Challenges\": \"Explain why you chose this difficulty level based on the Rubric.

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user104\n**Date:** 2018-04-17\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user104\n**Date:** 2020-12-07\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nSteps -

Further analysis unlikely to change conclusion.\n- Moderate: Mixed but interpretable evidence. 2+ signals with partial consistency, some contradictions \n  that don't override the main pattern. Requires careful weighing. Refinement may help clarify.\n- Difficult: Sparse, contradictory, or highly ambiguous evidence. <2 clear signals OR multiple strong \n  contradictions. Multiple interpretations possible. Further analysis unlikely to resolve ambiguity.\n\n## Output Format\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"Prediction\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Depression\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Stress\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\"\n  },\n  \"Confidence\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Depression\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Stress\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\"\n  },\n  \"Key_Insights\": \"Summarize the main patterns and indicators you observed in 2-3 sentences\",\n  \"Difficulty\": \"Easy\" or \"Moderate\" or \"Difficult\",\n  \"Challenges\": \"Explain why you chose this difficulty level based on the Rubric.

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user104\n**Date:** 2018-10-29\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user104\n**Date:** 2018-05-09\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user137\n**Date:** 2020-05-14\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user137\n**Date:** 2021-05-12\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

Requires careful weighing. Refinement may help clarify.\n- Difficult: Sparse, contradictory, or highly ambiguous evidence. <2 clear signals OR multiple strong \n  contradictions. Multiple interpretations possible. Further analysis unlikely to resolve ambiguity.\n\n## Output Format\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"Prediction\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Depression\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Stress\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\"\n  },\n  \"Confidence\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Depression\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Stress\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\"\n  },\n  \"Key_Insights\": \"Summarize the main patterns and indicators you observed in 2-3 sentences\",\n  \"Difficulty\": \"Easy\" or \"Moderate\" or \"Difficult\",\n  \"Challenges\": \"Explain why you chose this difficulty level based on the Rubric.

Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user137\n**Date:** 2020-05-30\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

Further analysis unlikely to change conclusion.\n- Moderate: Mixed but interpretable evidence. 2+ signals with partial consistency, some contradictions \n  that don't override the main pattern. Requires careful weighing. Refinement may help clarify.\n- Difficult: Sparse, contradictory, or highly ambiguous evidence. <2 clear signals OR multiple strong \n  contradictions. Multiple interpretations possible. Further analysis unlikely to resolve ambiguity.\n\n## Output Format\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"Prediction\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Depression\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Stress\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\"\n  },\n  \"Confidence\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Depression\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Stress\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\"\n  },\n  \"Key_Insights\": \"Summarize the main patterns and indicators you observed in 2-3 sentences\",\n  \"Difficulty\": \"Easy\" or \"Moderate\" or \"Difficult\",\n  \"Challenges\": \"Explain why you chose this difficulty level based on the Rubric.

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user137\n**Date:** 2020-09-22\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user137\n**Date:** 2018-10-06\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

Be clear and direct - you will have \nopportunities to refine later if needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must adhere to the following assessment rubric and output format.\n\n## Difficulty Assessment Rubric\nYou MUST classify the difficulty of this prediction based on the evidence quality:\n- Easy: Clear, converging evidence. 3+ consistent signals across modalities with minimal contradictions. \n  High confidence is appropriate. Further analysis unlikely to change conclusion.\n- Moderate: Mixed but interpretable evidence. 2+ signals with partial consistency, some contradictions \n  that don't override the main pattern. Requires careful weighing. Refinement may help clarify.\n- Difficult: Sparse, contradictory, or highly ambiguous evidence. <2 clear signals OR multiple strong \n  contradictions. Multiple interpretations possible. Further analysis unlikely to resolve ambiguity.\n\n## Output Format\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"Prediction\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Depression\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Stress\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\"\n  },\n  \"Confidence\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Depression\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Stress\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\"\n  },\n  \"Key_Insights\": \"Summarize the main patterns and indicators you observed in 2-3 sentences\",\n  \"Difficulty\": \"Easy\" or \"Moderate\" or \"Difficult\",\n  \"Challenges\": \"Explain why you chose this difficulty level based on the Rubric.

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user75\n**Date:** 2017-12-04\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

Be clear and direct - you will have \nopportunities to refine later if needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must adhere to the following assessment rubric and output format.\n\n## Difficulty Assessment Rubric\nYou MUST classify the difficulty of this prediction based on the evidence quality:\n- Easy: Clear, converging evidence. 3+ consistent signals across modalities with minimal contradictions. \n  High confidence is appropriate. Further analysis unlikely to change conclusion.\n- Moderate: Mixed but interpretable evidence. 2+ signals with partial consistency, some contradictions \n  that don't override the main pattern. Requires careful weighing. Refinement may help clarify.\n- Difficult: Sparse, contradictory, or highly ambiguous evidence. <2 clear signals OR multiple strong \n  contradictions. Multiple interpretations possible. Further analysis unlikely to resolve ambiguity.\n\n## Output Format\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"Prediction\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Depression\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Stress\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\"\n  },\n  \"Confidence\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Depression\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Stress\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\"\n  },\n  \"Key_Insights\": \"Summarize the main patterns and indicators you observed in 2-3 sentences\",\n  \"Difficulty\": \"Easy\" or \"Moderate\" or \"Difficult\",\n  \"Challenges\": \"Explain why you chose this difficulty level based on the Rubric. For 'Easy', explain what made it clear. For 'Moderate', what aspects are mixed? For 'Difficult', why is it ambiguous?\",\n  \"Focus_Areas_for_Refinement\": \"If Moderate or Difficult: what specific aspects should be examined more carefully in the next analysis?

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user75\n**Date:** 2017-11-25\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

Further analysis unlikely to change conclusion.\n- Moderate: Mixed but interpretable evidence. 2+ signals with partial consistency, some contradictions \n  that don't override the main pattern. Requires careful weighing. Refinement may help clarify.\n- Difficult: Sparse, contradictory, or highly ambiguous evidence. <2 clear signals OR multiple strong \n  contradictions. Multiple interpretations possible. Further analysis unlikely to resolve ambiguity.\n\n## Output Format\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"Prediction\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Depression\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Stress\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\"\n  },\n  \"Confidence\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Depression\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Stress\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\"\n  },\n  \"Key_Insights\": \"Summarize the main patterns and indicators you observed in 2-3 sentences\",\n  \"Difficulty\": \"Easy\" or \"Moderate\" or \"Difficult\",\n  \"Challenges\": \"Explain why you chose this difficulty level based on the Rubric.

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user75\n**Date:** 2018-02-11\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user75\n**Date:** 2018-01-02\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensor-derived behavioral features collected from college students.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Stress score > 2)\n\n## Context\nThe data is from college students. Academic schedule and social life may affect their behavior patterns, \nbut avoid assuming specific causes without supporting evidence.\n\nNote that depression and anxiety are typically assessed over the past two weeks, reflecting longer-term affective trends, whereas stress levels often represent current or recent states.\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from the target user's historical records.*\n\n### Example 1\n**User:** user75\n**Date:** 2018-02-11\n\n\nSensor Features:\n28 day summary features (P2W slope and R2W slope are calculated based on the past 2 weeks and recent 2 weeks trend):\nLocation -

Further analysis unlikely to change conclusion.\n- Moderate: Mixed but interpretable evidence. 2+ signals with partial consistency, some contradictions \n  that don't override the main pattern. Requires careful weighing. Refinement may help clarify.\n- Difficult: Sparse, contradictory, or highly ambiguous evidence. <2 clear signals OR multiple strong \n  contradictions. Multiple interpretations possible. Further analysis unlikely to resolve ambiguity.\n\n## Output Format\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"Prediction\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Depression\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\",\n    \"Stress\": \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\"\n  },\n  \"Confidence\": {\n    \"Anxiety\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Depression\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\",\n    \"Stress\": \"High\" or \"Medium\" or \"Low\"\n  },\n  \"Key_Insights\": \"Summarize the main patterns and indicators you observed in 2-3 sentences\",\n  \"Difficulty\": \"Easy\" or \"Moderate\" or \"Difficult\",\n  \"Challenges\": \"Explain why you chose this difficulty level based on the Rubric.
