  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensors, smart home IoT devices, using frequent ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) collected throughout the day.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2 over 1-2 hours before survey)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2 over 1-2 hours before survey)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Self-reported stress > 2 on 5-point scale (1=Not stressed at all, 3=Somewhat stressed, 5=Very stressed) over 1-2 hours before survey)\n\n## Context\nThe data combines smartphone sensors, smart home IoT devices (home appliances and environmental sensors), and withings sleep pad measurements.\n\n**Considerations:**\n- IoT (door, motion, TV, appliances) and environmental sensors (humidity, temperature, air quality) capture home activity and comfort context.\n- Sleep pad data (deep/light/REM, efficiency) provides objective sleep quality.\n- Yesterday\u2019s data are split into 6 time windows; the past hour reflects current context.\n- Frequent EMAs detect short-term mental state fluctuations.\n\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensors, smart home IoT devices, using frequent ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) collected throughout the day.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2 over 1-2 hours before survey)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2 over 1-2 hours before survey)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Self-reported stress > 2 on 5-point scale (1=Not stressed at all, 3=Somewhat stressed, 5=Very stressed) over 1-2 hours before survey)\n\n## Context\nThe data combines smartphone sensors, smart home IoT devices (home appliances and environmental sensors), and withings sleep pad measurements.\n\n**Considerations:**\n- IoT (door, motion, TV, appliances) and environmental sensors (humidity, temperature, air quality) capture home activity and comfort context.\n- Sleep pad data (deep/light/REM, efficiency) provides objective sleep quality.\n- Yesterday\u2019s data are split into 6 time windows; the past hour reflects current context.\n- Frequent EMAs detect short-term mental state fluctuations.\n\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensors, smart home IoT devices, using frequent ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) collected throughout the day.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2 over 1-2 hours before survey)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2 over 1-2 hours before survey)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Self-reported stress > 2 on 5-point scale (1=Not stressed at all, 3=Somewhat stressed, 5=Very stressed) over 1-2 hours before survey)\n\n## Context\nThe data combines smartphone sensors, smart home IoT devices (home appliances and environmental sensors), and withings sleep pad measurements.\n\n**Considerations:**\n- IoT (door, motion, TV, appliances) and environmental sensors (humidity, temperature, air quality) capture home activity and comfort context.\n- Sleep pad data (deep/light/REM, efficiency) provides objective sleep quality.\n- Yesterday\u2019s data are split into 6 time windows; the past hour reflects current context.\n- Frequent EMAs detect short-term mental state fluctuations.\n\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step

  "# Mental Health Prediction Task\n\n## Role\nYou are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.\n\n## Task\nPredict mental health risk levels (anxiety, depression, and stress) from smartphone sensors, smart home IoT devices, using frequent ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) collected throughout the day.\n\n**Prediction Targets:**\n- **Anxiety**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2 over 1-2 hours before survey)\n- **Depression**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: PHQ-4 depression score > 2 over 1-2 hours before survey)\n- **Stress**: Low Risk or High Risk (threshold: Self-reported stress > 2 on 5-point scale (1=Not stressed at all, 3=Somewhat stressed, 5=Very stressed) over 1-2 hours before survey)\n\n## Context\nThe data combines smartphone sensors, smart home IoT devices (home appliances and environmental sensors), and withings sleep pad measurements.\n\n**Considerations:**\n- IoT (door, motion, TV, appliances) and environmental sensors (humidity, temperature, air quality) capture home activity and comfort context.\n- Sleep pad data (deep/light/REM, efficiency) provides objective sleep quality.\n- Yesterday\u2019s data are split into 6 time windows; the past hour reflects current context.\n- Frequent EMAs detect short-term mental state fluctuations.\n\nUse the following symptom\u2013feature mappings as soft guidelines, not absolute rules, since sensor data may be noisy or incomplete.\n\n**Depression Indicators:**\n- Anhedonia\n  * Call count, Total distance, Number of places visited\n  * Decreased social interactions and reduced movement\n- Insomnia or hypersomnia\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Irregular sleep pattern or excessive sleep\n- Psychomotor agitation or retardation\n  * Daily step count, Total distance, Time at home\n  * Reduced activity (retardation) or restless increase in activity (agitation)\n- Fatigue or loss of energy\n  * Daily step count\n  * Persistent decrease in daily steps from baseline\n- Diminished ability to think or concentrate\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention (frequent, short)\n\n**Anxiety Indicators:**\n- Restlessness or feeling keyed up / on edge\n  * Daily step count\n  * Frequent movement\n- Easily fatigued\n  * Daily step count\n  * Decreased daily activity and rapid decline in energy\n- Difficulty concentrating\n  * Screen unlock duration, App session duration, App switching\n  * Shortened sustained attention, fragmented focus\n- Sleep disturbance\n  * Sleep duration, Sleep efficiency, Duration in bed\n  * Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fragmented sleep patterns\n\n**Stress Indicators:**\n- Physiological arousal\n  * Movement patterns, Sleep quality\n  * Heightened restlessness, erratic activity, reduced sleep quality\n- Avoidance and withdrawal behaviors\n  * Time at home, Social interactions, Daily activity levels\n  * Reduced mobility, limited social engagement, and withdrawal from usual routines reflecting coping or exhaustion\n- Cognitive overload\n  * Screen usage patterns, App session duration, App switching\n  * Distracted attention, increased phone checking, difficulty focusing\n- Disrupted daily rhythm\n  * Sleep timing, Activity timing, Location transitions\n  * Irregular schedules, inconsistent activity timing, and unstable routine patterns\n\n**Notes:**\n- Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some examples of previous assessments to help guide your prediction:\n\n*The following examples are the most recent data from
