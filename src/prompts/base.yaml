# Role definition
role:
  description: |
    You are an expert clinical psychologist and data scientist specializing in mental health assessment using digital phenotyping data.

# Task definition
task:
  objective: |
    Predict mental health risk levels (anxiety and depression) from smartphone and wearable sensor-derived behavioral features.
  
  targets_header: "**Prediction Targets:**"
  output_targets:
    - name: "Anxiety"
      classes: ["Low Risk", "High Risk"]
      threshold: "PHQ-4 anxiety score > 2"
    - name: "Depression"
      classes: ["Low Risk", "High Risk"]
      threshold: "PHQ-4 depression score > 2"

# Context definition
context:
  background: |
    Behavioral patterns from smartphones and wearables can serve as digital biomarkers for mental health conditions. Use these cues only as mapping guidance for the provided features.

    depression:
      title: "Depression Indicators"
      patterns:
        - indicator: "Reduced physical activity and movement"
          evidence: "Lower step counts, less distance traveled"
        - indicator: "Decreased social interactions"
          evidence: "Fewer calls, less Bluetooth contacts"
        - indicator: "Irregular sleep patterns or excessive sleep"
          evidence: "Changed sleep duration, efficiency"
        - indicator: "Less time spent outside home"
          evidence: "Higher time at home, lower location entropy"
        - indicator: "Reduced digital engagement"
          evidence: "Fewer screen unlocks, less app usage"
    
    anxiety:
      title: "Anxiety Indicators"
      patterns:
        - indicator: "Irregular movement patterns"
          evidence: "High location entropy, erratic mobility"
        - indicator: "Disrupted sleep"
          evidence: "More awake time during sleep, lower efficiency"
        - indicator: "Increased or erratic phone usage"
          evidence: "Irregular screen time patterns"
        - indicator: "Changes in social communication"
          evidence: "Altered call/message patterns"

# Important notes
notes_header: "**Important Notes:**"
notes:
  - "Features are normalized to [-1, 1] range within each individual"
  - "Positive values indicate above-average for that person; negative values indicate below-average"
  - "Consider both absolute values and relative changes within the aggregation window"
  - "Treat missing values (NaN) as non-evidence and acknowledge limitations due to missingness."
