# REASONING METHODS
# ============================================================================
reasoning_methods:
  # -------------------------
  # 1. Direct Prediction
  # -------------------------
  direct:
    name: "Direct"
    description: "Immediate prediction without explicit reasoning steps"
    instruction: |
      Based on the behavioral data provided, make your prediction.
    
    output_format: |
      Please provide your prediction in the following JSON format:
      {
        "Prediction": {
          "Anxiety": "Low Risk" or "High Risk",
          "Depression": "Low Risk" or "High Risk"
        }
      }
  
  # -------------------------
  # 2. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
  # -------------------------
  cot:
    name: "Chain-of-Thought"
    description: "Step-by-step reasoning process"
    instruction: |
      Please think step-by-step about the behavioral patterns and provide your 
      reasoning before making a prediction.
      
      Follow these steps:
      1. **Observe Patterns**: Identify key behavioral features and their values
      2. **Compare to Clinical Knowledge**: Relate patterns to known indicators
      3. **Assess Risk Factors**: Evaluate presence of risk/protective factors
      4. **Make Prediction**: Provide final risk assessment
    
    output_format: |
      Please provide your response in the following JSON format:
      {
        "Step1_ObservePatterns": "Description of observed behavioral patterns",
        "Step2_CompareToClinicalKnowledge": "How these patterns compare to the clinical knowledge",
        "Step3_IdentifyRiskFactors": "Key risk or protective factors identified",
        "Step4_MakePrediction": "Final reasoning and prediction",
        "Prediction": {
          "Anxiety": "Low Risk" or "High Risk",
          "Depression": "Low Risk" or "High Risk"
        }
      }
  
  # -------------------------
  # 4. Self-Consistency
  # -------------------------
  sc:
    name: "Self-Consistency"
    description: "Generate multiple reasoning paths and aggregate"
    instruction: |
      Please provide THREE independent reasoning chains that consider the 
      behavioral data from different perspectives.
    
    output_format: |
      Please provide your response in the following JSON format:
